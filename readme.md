# Intro

Creating a PR is highly appreciated!

This module is a multifunctional and easy-to-use wrapper around [ChakraCore](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore) JavaScript engine (WIP)

This wrapper includes:
Fully customizable module system, and powerful builtin one, which can import not just javascript modules, but also json, json6, yml modules (WIP).
Intuitive wrappers around objects, numbers, bigints, arrays, functions and classes.

Docs: WIP

I want to give special thanks to @rhuanjl for helping me resolving issues with the Module System.
